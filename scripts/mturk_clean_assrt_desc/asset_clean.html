      <strong>Instructions: </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Please describe the asset image shown in very few words.</li>
        <li>Use short succint phrases like "brown wooden table", or "blue leather couch" that describe the salient attributes (color, shape, material, etc) of the asset in a natural way.</li>
        <li>Even though these are graphics renderings, do <b>not</b> use phrases like "a graphics rendering of", "3D rendered" etc. Just describe the asset by the attributes the best you can as if it were a real image.</li>
        <li>To help you, we are including the type/name of the object asset (eg, couch, or countertop, or fridge, etc). Use this to guide you to write an accurate short phrase.</li>
        <li>We are also including the GPT4 description. <b>The GPT4 description is noisy</b>. So, please use it cautiously when writing the phrase. </li>
        <li>We will independently verify the asset descriptions. Descriptions that other workers think are incorrect will <b>not</b> be approved. So, please do the HITs diligently.</li>
      </ul>
